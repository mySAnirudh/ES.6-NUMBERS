    The Number object represents numerical date, either integers or floating-point numbers. 
In general, you do not need to worry about Number objects because the browser 
automatically converts number literals to instances of the number class.
Following is the syntax for creating a number object.
var val = new Number(number);
In the place of number, if you provide any non-number argument, then the argument 
cannot be converted into a number, it returns NaN (Not-a-Number).
